Provide Insights to Management in the Consumer Goods Domain (SQL Project)

This project focuses on solving real-world business problems in the consumer goods industry using SQL. The objective was to support AtliQ Hardwares’ management team by extracting meaningful insights from their sales, pricing, and customer datasets through structured SQL analysis.

📌 Project Overview

AtliQ Hardwares is a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India with a growing global presence. The management team observed a lack of actionable insights that could support fast and effective decision-making.

To address this challenge, a set of 10 real business queries was provided as part of a hiring task. Each query required writing SQL code, analyzing relational datasets, and presenting the findings clearly.

This project showcases my ability to understand business requirements, explore datasets, write optimized SQL queries, and convert raw output into valuable insights that management can act upon.
