## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardwares is a leading computer hardware manufacturer in India with a growing international presence. The management team identified a lack of actionable insights required for fast and effective decision-making.

To address this, ten business queries were provided as part of a hiring challenge. Each query required SQL analysis, interpretation of results, and clear communication of insights. This project demonstrates the ability to translate business needs into structured SQL solutions and insights.

## Objectives

- Understand each business question clearly  
- Identify the correct tables and relationships  
- Write and execute efficient SQL queries  
- Translate query output into meaningful insights  
- Present the results using a structured video created with Clipchamp  

## Dataset Overview

The datasets used in this project include the following fact and dimension tables:

- fact_sales_monthly – Monthly sales data  
- fact_gross_price – Product gross pricing  
- fact_manufacturing_cost – Production and manufacturing cost  
- fact_pre_invoice_discount – Pre-invoice discount details  
- fact_post_invoice_discount – Post-invoice discount details  
- dim_customer – Customer profile and market information  
- dim_product – Product information and category details  

These datasets support analysis across revenue, pricing, profitability, customer behavior, and market performance.

## Approach

1. Understand the requirement behind each business question  
2. Identify necessary tables, keys, and joins  
3. Write optimized SQL queries  
4. Interpret and summarize insights for management
